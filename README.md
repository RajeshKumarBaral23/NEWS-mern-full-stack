# NEWS-mern-full-stack
Week 1 Updates:

This week, the backend for the project was set up using Express and MongoDB. A sample /api/news route was created to return mock news data. Basic security was implemented with Helmet and CORS, and request logging was configured for easier debugging. Static file hosting was also set up for future frontend integration. MongoDB was connected for data storage, and error handling was put in place to manage 404 and other server errors. Rate limiting was considered but will be reintroduced in future updates. Expect more features and data integration in the coming weeks.
